# Unity-UGUI-Shader-Pack
A Unity3D pack of shaders for UGUI that has a whole series of gradients

Creating for some of my games:  http://www.natenesler.com

Allows you to modify gradients on the fly in the edtor without having gradient images that have to be edited and resaved everytime you want a different gradient.
